# Animation

Animations fall into one of two categories: tween- or physics-based.

## Animation types

### Tween animation

In a tween animation, the beginning and ending points are defined, as well as a timeline, and a curve that defines the timing and speed of the transition.

### Physics-based animation

In physics-based animation, motion is modeled to resemble real-world behavior.
